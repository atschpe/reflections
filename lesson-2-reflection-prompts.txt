What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It is created but nothing is added. IN doing so you create the space to keep track of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a holding pen ready for committing, whilst the working area is more like a desk where you are handling and working with the files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By running git status as well using git diff I can review any changes made and what they are to ensure any commits I plan to make are logical

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	
	Each branch helps maintain its own train of thought which can later be united into the master branch once it works in itself

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	It shows how each commit relates to its parents and thus how to trace back in time to common points. Likewise it enables to move through the version history and be aware of unreachables.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	It unites new additions from both branches enabling you to move forward with the combined code.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	It unites the new code together, however this can result in less (to git) obvious code being double or overlap in work by different functions if not checked.
